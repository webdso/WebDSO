Various JS stuff required for DSO (digital signal oscilloscope) output vizualization with a regular web browser.

Manifest:

 - gnuplot - JS scripts required for gnuplot's "canvas" terminal. These files
	     were copied from /usr/local/share/gnuplot/5.2/js generated by 
	     gnuplot installer.

 - Chart.js - JS plot library found somewhere at sourceforge.com, library home
	      - https://www.chartjs.org/. This library could be considered as
	      Gnuplot replacement - at the very least it will work much faster.
	      However, Gnuplot provides nice controls over JS charts, 
	      particularly zoom and distance measurement. Hopefully these
	      featurs could be implemented with Chart.js plugins - see
	      https://github.com/chartjs/awesome, particularly "crosshair"
	      plugin (it makes some zoming) and "zoom" plagin (chart panning
	      and zoom).

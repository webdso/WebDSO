This directory keeps various HTML, JS and other files for visualizing DSO 
(digital signal oscilloscope) output with a regular web browser. Source
waveforms are retrieved by sending appropriate SCPI commands to DSO, received
waveforms are plotted by gnuplot utility. 

Main program is written with Perl, DSO communications are done through 
vxi11_cmd utility or via direct sock connection (configurable). Waveforms 
are plotted with gnuplot utility which generates plots as cryptic JS 
files with builtin plot controls. The program was developed for Keysight 
DSO6054x but could be ported to other compatible instruments. It runs under 
Linux, tested under OpenSUSE 13.x, 15.x and should work under other 
Linuxes too.

The software provides following DSO controls:

- Channels: 1-4 with the only channel visible at a time;
- DC/AC input selection;
- Plot start selection;
- Wavepoints: 100, 250, 500, 1000 (DSO falls to hardware error with greater
  no.wavepoints);
- Time range selection;
- Trigger source selection;
- DSO IP address selection or built-in imitator plot (program starts in 
  imitator mode).

All of this has no much practical sense but could be used to quickly check
some signal shape, verify DSO health or for other educational purposes.
This software was developed out of pure curiosity and to kill some time.

Manifest:

  - instruments/ - vxi_11.cmd utility to talk to physical DSO, test and
    demo SCPI's. This is modified version of vxi_11.cmd by Steve D. Sharples,
    http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/vxi11/. Updated source code is available
    upon request;
    
  - js/ - JS and image files;
  
  - modules/ - CPAN modules used for the project. These modules are here for
    offline installations;
  
  - DSO_for_poor.sh - trivial shell script to send a command to DSO, read and
    "enhance" the data returned and send them to gnuplot. The plot is shown on
    xterm window; Used for gnuplot commands testing and concept demo;
    
  - dsoCommon.pm - perl modules for this project;
  
  - dsoPlotData.pl - server-side script to control DSO, load and plot waveform 
    data. This script is launched via HTTP GET issued by simple.html page and
    returns the plot as JS file. The former is executed by simple.html and 
    nice plot is shown in your browser;
    
  - generator-16x16.png - fav.icon. Found somewhere in the development server;
    
  - README - this file.
  
  - simple.html - DSO visualization and control page. The only HTML page used
    to work with DSO;
    
  - dso.apache.conf - Apache configuration file to make the stuff work under
    Apache. Just for references;
